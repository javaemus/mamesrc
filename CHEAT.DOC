                     ==================


What is this?
=============

I know that using cheat will probably spoil a game, but I did
that because there is many games that I want to see but
never will if I have to play several weeks to finish them.

It is also very useful for driver makers like me because it
allow me to see all the levels of a game without having to play them.
Its very frustrating to play a game you do not really like, all
night just to pass the first level because someone tell you
that there is a bug in your driver on the second level.


The cheater in Mame operate much like the Pro Action Replay.
You can use cheat made by others, or you can search yourself
for a new cheat.

The file CHEAT.DAT contents several cheats that I have found.
This file is in pure text format, so you can see or edit
it with a text editor like Notepad.
Its a good idea to check that file just to have an idea of
what cheat are available. Its a lot faster than trying
all the games one after the others.


Operation
=========

-Start a game like usual in Mame.
-After the ram/rom test is passed, whenever you want to, press
  Tab to go to the menu.
 Note: it is important that you do not enable a cheat before the
  ram test is passed because it will probably fail and the game
  will not start. (The test is the garbage that you see when you
  start most games)
-Select CHEAT
-You should see:

  LOAD / ENABLE CHEAT
  START A NEW SEARCH
    CONTINUE SEARCH
     MEMORY WATCH

  RETURN TO MAIN MENU

    Active Cheats:
     --- NONE ---

-The first line is where to go to enable a cheat.
  The others lines are to search yourself for new cheats.
  Below that, you have a list of the currently active cheats.
  The first time you go there, no cheats are active so it
  display --- NONE --- to tell you that.
-Select LOAD/ENABLE CHEAT
-The upper part of the screen is where you can select the cheat you
  want to enable.
  The lower part is the list of the currently active cheats.
-If nothing appear between the lines:

       Select a Cheat
            and
       Active Cheats:

  it is because there is no cheat available for this game.
  Normally you will at least have the line:

    Infinite Lives

-To enable a cheat, just press ENTER on it.
  The name of the cheat should appear in the Active Cheats list.
-Pressing ENTER on a cheat that is already in the Active Cheats list
  delete it from that list.
-The Delete F1 and F2 buttons will be helpful when you will search
  your own cheat.
  Note: Delete, do not delete that cheat from the CHEAT.DAT file, it just
   delete it from the list in memory.
   But Pressing F1 on a cheat will save it to that file, so, pressing
	 F1 on an already saved cheat will save it again in the file. So next time
   you will have the same cheat twice.
   To remove it from the file, you will have to edit the CHEAT.DAT file
   with a text editor like Notepad.
-Press ESC/TAB three times to return to the game.
-Start a game, you should see a difference.
-During the game, if you have to disable the cheats temporarily, press F7.
  (Has I write those lines I am not sure that it is F7 that will be chosen
   to do that, see the Mame docs if not)

NOTE: Enabling a cheat, even for a short time, will disable the
 hi-score saving. If you want to reenable hi-score saving, you will
 have to restart Mame.



How to search for new cheat code
================================

Mame Action Replay only change values that are in RAM
The idea is to replace a memory location with a fixed value.
The program will never be able to change that location during the
time the cheat is activated.
So, if you know where the lives are, placing a 3 at that location
will do that you will always have 3 lives.

The easiest thing to find are lives or other numbers that you can see
on the screen.
But you can also search to have a certain power for a long time instead
of just for a short time normally.
In the game 1984, if you perform a looping, you are invincible during the
time you are in looping. So you can search to have that invincibility
during all the game.
In Pacman, you can search for a code that keep the ghost blue
all the time.


Here is what to do when you want to start searching for a cheat code.
More later on what to do after.

There is 5 methods available to search for a cheat code.
Each of them has their own advantage, with practice
you will learn witch to choose from depending on what
is you are searching for.
Here is the description of the methods and an example of
how to use them.

-Method 1 is to search a known number and follow its value.
      Good for lives or other numbers.
  -Here is the steps to find the lives in Dig Dug (Namco).
  -Start Mame.
  -Start a game.
  -Goto the START NEW SEARCH menu.
  -Select "Lives or other number"
  -With the arrow enter the number of lives you had at the bottom
    of the screen while in the game. Normally 2, but depend of
    your Dip Switch setting. Then Press ENTER.
  -Return to the game.
  -Die.
  -Go to the CONTINUE SEARCH menu.
  -Enter the number of lives you have left. Normally 1.
  -The program will display all the locations that match your criteria.
    If you have done it properly (starting with 2 lives) you should see
    2 entrys:
     840A = 02
     840C = 02
    It mean that the locations $840A and $840C had 02 in them when you
    started the search and its the only two locations that have 1 in them now.
  -We will try to narrow the list to 1 entry.
  -Return to the game
  -Die again.
  -Goto the CONTINUE SEARCH menu.
  -Enter the number of lives you have left. Normally 0.
  -The list is the same, so we will try to find witch is the good one.
  -Press F2 to copy them in the Loaded Cheat list. Or Press ENTER
    on each of them.
  -Press ESC/TAB
  -Go to the LOAD/ENABLE CHEAT menu
  -You should see your 2 entry in the upper list.
  -Select the first (840A) press ENTER on it to copy it in the Active Cheat list.
  -Return to the game.
  -Die.
  -Since it was your last life you should be Game Over but you are not.
    Its a Good code.
    What was the other for?
    Try it.
  -Go to the LOAD/ENABLE CHEAT menu
  -Press ENTER on the 840A entry to remove it from the Active list
  -Press ENTER on the 840C entry to copy it in the Active list.
  -Return to the game.
  -Die. It do the same thing of the other cheat.
    It happen, there is 2 locations for the lives in that game.
    So either one should good.
  -Return to the LOAD/ENABLE CHEAT menu
  -Select the 840A or 840C entry, press F1 to save it in the file.
  -In this version you cannot edit the name of the cheat.
   So the only thing you have to do is to edit the CHEAT.DAT file
    to put a meaningful comment instead of the 840A = 02
    The last line of the file should be:

    digdugnm:0:840A:2:0:840A = 02

    While you are there, you can change the 2 to 6 so you will see
    5 or 6 lives at the bottom of the screen when you will activate this
    cheat. Finish result:

    digdugnm:0:840A:6:0:Infinite Lives
  -From now on when you will start Dig Dug you will have Infinite Lives
    in the list of cheats for that game.


  Note: With lives, you can have 2 value: the number of
   lives displayed or the number displayed + 1 witch is
	 the real number if lives you have. The method 1 will
   search for the number you enter and the number - 1.

   In Pacman you will find the 2, because there is one
   variable that is your lives that when it will reach 0
   you will die, and there is the variable of the lives
   left displayed on the screen.

-Method 2 ask by how much the number you search has changed
  since the last time. Good for timers ,lives and level search.
  Note that this search is not perform in reference to the
  start value but from a backup of the ram that is done each
	time you select continue search.

  Start a game with 3 lives, start the cheater, he will backup the ram.
  Lose one live, tell the cheater that the value is now -1 since
  the start. Lose another live, tell the cheater that the value
  is another -1 since the last time. the cheater save the ram
  each time you tell him a value.

-Method 3 is to search for energy bar or any value that you can tell
   if it is lower, equal or greater than the last time.
  Note that this search is not perform in reference to when you started
	but in reference to the last time you continued the search.
	In Kung Fu Master the player have an energy bar, we will find it.
  -Start a game in Hung Fu Master.
  -Wait a little for the game to start.
  -When you can start moving, your energy bar is full.
	-Go to START NEW SEARCH
  -Select "Energy (less or more)"
	-Return to the game.
  -Wait for an enemy to grab you
  -Your energy will start to decrease
  -Go to CONTINUE SEARCH
	-Select "New value is smaller"
	-Return to the game.
  -Wait just a little bit that your energy can decrease a little more
  -Go to CONTINUE SEARCH
	-Select "New value is smaller"
	-Return to the game.
  -Wait just a little bit that your energy can decrease a little more
  -Go to CONTINUE SEARCH
	-Select "New value is smaller"
  -You should have less than 10 entrys
    But we will try to eliminate more of them
	-Return to the game.
  -Wait till you die, wait so that your energy is now full
  -Go to CONTINUE SEARCH
	-Select "New value is greater"
	-Return to the game.
  -Wait just a little, your energy should remain full
  -Go to CONTINUE SEARCH
	-Select "New value is equal"
  -Ah, 2 entrys left, press F2 to register them in the list

  -You will see later that the first is the good one (E709 = 3F)
    the second (E81A = 3F) is only for displaying the bar, you
    are dying after a while but the bar display full.

-Method 4 is to search for a status bit.
  Good to search for invincibility and weapon.
  In 1942 you are invincible when you perform a looping, we will try
  to search for that state.
  -Start a game.
	-Press the looping button.
	-While in looping go to START NEW SEARCH
  -Select "Status (bit)"
	-Return to the game.
	-When the looping is finished, wait a little
  -Go to CONTINUE SEARCH
	-Select "Opposite from start"
	-Goto the game.
	-Start a looping.
	-While in the looping, go to CONTINUE SEARCH
	-Select "Same as start"
  -Repeat as many times as required to narrow the list to a minimum
  -After about 10 times I had 6 entry.
  -Follow the procedure describe above and you should find that
    E0A5 = 02  is the cheat for invincibility.

-Method 5 is the last resort. The cheater will search for a byte that
  is the same or different from when you started. Its very much
  like method 4 but since it will search for a whole byte, you
  will have different result with this method.


NOTE: While in the game, press ` (tilde) to go directly to the CONTINUE CHEAT
       page. (Has I write those lines, I am not certain that ` is
       the key choosen to do this. See the Mame docs if it do not work.
       Or it may be that this key is not implemented at all.)

NOTE2: To find certain cheat, you may want to reset the emulation
        with F3. This will not affect the status of the current
				search and may be useful if you want to start a new game
				and redo the same actions but with just a little difference.



When searching for lives, 2-3 times of telling the cheater
 the number of lives you have and you probably will have a list
 of 1 or 2 value. But when searching for a Status, you probably
 will be stuck with more than 10 or 20 values. When you see that
 the length of the list do not decrease anymore, do the following:

-When you have the list on the screen, press F2 to copy them
  in the loaded list. The limit of the Loaded list is 100 entrys.
-Go to the LOAD/ENABLE CHEAT screen.
-You should have your list there.
-Enable some of them (5 to 10)
  You cannot enable more than 10 at the same time.
-Go to the game to see what effect this have.
-If there is no noticeable effect, or if the effect is not what
  you where searching for, return in the LOAD/ENABLE CHEAT screen.
-Delete those entry that you precedently enabled by pressing the Delete button.
  Don't worry disabling them from the active list, deleting a code from
  the upper list delete it also in the active list.
  Like I said earlier, Delete do not affect the CHEAT.DAT file.
  So, you may delete the already found codes like Infinite Lives to
  have more space. This list is limited to 100 entrys.
-Enable other codes, return to the game to see what happen.
-When you have the effect you want in the game, you will be sure
  that the wanted code is in the ones you enabled, so , go enable
  them one at the time.
-When you have found one code that you want to keep, press F1 when he
  is highlighted to save it in the CHEAT.DAT file.
  In this version, you cannot assign a name to cheats, you will have
  to edit the CHEAT.DAT file with a text editor. (Like Notepad)


NOTE: With this version, you cannot edit the parameters of the cheat.
  But you can edit them in the CHEAT.DAT file.
  Normally, for Infinite Lives, I put a larger than usual number
  so that the player will see an abnormal number of lives remembering
  him that he cheat.
  A line in that file consist of 5 fields separated by a colon (:)
   -The name of the game (short)
   -The number of the CPU for games with multiple CPU
	      (Always 0 in this version)
   -The address to affect (in Hexadecimal)
   -The data to put at that address (in Hexadecimal)
   -Special function, see below, usually 0
   -The description (30 characters)
  A line that begin by a semicolon (;) is a comments.

Special function:
 0-Normal, update ram when DoCheat is Called
 1-Write in ram just one time then delete cheat from active list
 2-Wait a second between 2 writes
 3-Wait 2 second between 2 writes
 4-Wait 5 second between 2 writes
 5-When the original value is not like the cheat, wait 1 second then write it
    Needed by Tempest for the Super Zapper
 6-When the original value is not like the cheat, wait 2 second then write it
 7-When the original value is not like the cheat, wait 5 second then write it
 8-Do not change if value decrease by 1 each frames
 9-Do not change if value decrease by 2 each frames
10-Do not change if value decrease by 3 each frames
11-Do not change if value decrease by 4 each frames

Note: 8,9,10,11 are used to try to not lock the game if a bonus is awarded
       for energy or timer at the end of a level.


MEMORY WATCH
============

This feature can be useful when searching for cheats. It allow
you to examine the behaviour of a memory location in real time
when you play.



   Have fun.



Excuse my english, I speak english like you speak french ;-).
